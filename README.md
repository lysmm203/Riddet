# Final Project Name

Riddet

## Description

To initialize the website, simply run flask initdb and then flask run and then go to http://localhost:8000 in any web browser.

To use Riddet, the user must first sign up. To do this, the user can click "Sign up" in the top right of the screen. They should then type their username and password of choice, with the only limiter being that they cannot pick the same username as a pre-existing user. After that, the user will be able to post and reply to other user's posts. To make a post, simply click "Post" in the top right of the screen and enter the title you want for your post and also the content of the post. After posting they will be redirected to the main screen to see their post. From here the user can click on "Edit/Delete" on the post they created to either edit the title or content of the post or to delete it outright. On this same page, users can also comment on posts by clicking "Reply". They can then type the content of their reply and other users can see what they wrote. If at any time whie on Riddet a user wishes to go back to seeing the posts, they may click "Timeline" and it will take them to the homescreen to see all of the posts users have made.
