# Final Project Name

Riddet

## Description

To initialize the website, simply run flask initdb and then flask run and then go to http://localhost:8000 in any web browser.

To use Riddet, the user must first sign up. To do this, the user can click "Sign up" in the top right of the screen. They should then type their username and password of choice, with the only limiter being that they cannot pick the same username as a pre-existing user. After that, the user will be able to make post by specifying a title and the content of their post. To make a post, simply click "Post" in the top right of the screen and enter the title you want for your post and also the content of the post. After posting they will be redirected to the main screen to see their post. From here the user can click on "Edit" to edit the content of the post by specifying its title or they can delete posts by checking the box under each post and clicking delete. If at any time whie on Riddet a user wishes to go back to seeing the posts, they may click "Timeline" or on the logo on the top left and it will take them to the homescreen to see all of the posts users have made.
